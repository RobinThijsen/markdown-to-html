<h2>A funny story</h2>
<p>At 20 when I was watching videos on youtube, I tried a color blind test on a video of Dr. Nozman.<br/>
	At this moment, I didn't knowing I was color blind so I made them like "Yeah, no prob.".<br/>
	But arrived at some red and green test color. I see the number color blind is supposed to see.<br/>
	In a whole doubt, I check if its normal in the comment of the video and on internet.<br  />>
	But the verdict dropped, I was color blind.<br  />
	Thankfully, thats so light i don't even discovered it during 20 years.
</p>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I discovered I am color blind at the age of 20 when I was watching a video of Dr. Nozman who was displaying color blind exercices.</p>
